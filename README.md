Purpose:
The main purpose of this programming assignment is to revise the topics that we have
covered in the first six weeks including fundamentals of C programming, conditional 
statements, repetitive statements, and functions.

Description:
You will write a program for playing a Big Pig game between a player and computer. Big Pig
is a dice game which is the variation of Two-Dice Pig game. This will give you practice with all 
three control constructs (sequence, selection and repetition). We are including some design 
constraints in the “programming task” section, so you will also need to use functions. This will 
give you the experience of decomposing a problem into parts, and then implementing each 
part in one highly cohesive, loosely coupled function. 


HOW TO PLAY:
